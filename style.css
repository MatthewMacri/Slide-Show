/*Position Relative vs Absolute

https://kolosek.com/css-position-relative-vs-position-absolute/#:~:text=Relative%20%2D%20the%20element%20is%20positioned,related%20to%20the%20browser%20window.

A relative positioned element can be moved to any direction by using the properties(offset properties) 
such as left, right, top and bottom. And the values provided in those properties is calculated based 
on the position where the element sits. And the surrounding elements of a relative positioned element 
is aware of its existence in the document flow. So, they don’t consume the space of the relative positioned 
element after it has been moved to a different position on the page.

In absolute positioned element, it is the opposite. The surrounding elements consume the space of 
the absolute positioned element cause they assume that the absolute positioned element do not 
exist in the document flow. And an absolute positioned element can be moved in a same way you’d 
move a relative positioned element using properties (offset properties) such as left, right, top and bottom, 
but the values provided in those properties are calculated based upon its closest ancestor’s container 
that has a relative position, meaning if the parent of the absolute positioned element has “position: 
relative”, then giving the absolute positioned child a value of “top: 0px” will move the child towards 
the top border of the relative positioned ancestor. If no ancestor has a relative position. 
Then the absolute positioned element will make the body element its relative positioned ancestor. 
And use the body element as its container.
